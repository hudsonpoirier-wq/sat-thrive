# The Agora Project

A full-featured SAT & ACT test preparation platform built with React, Vite, and Supabase. Students take timed practice tests, get personalized study plans, review mistakes, track progress, and explore college admissions — all from one dashboard.

## Quick Start (clone to deploy in 15 minutes)

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18 or higher ([download](https://nodejs.org/))
- **npm** v9 or higher (comes with Node)
- A free **Supabase** account ([supabase.com](https://supabase.com))
- A free **Vercel** account ([vercel.com](https://vercel.com)) — or any static host
- A **GitHub** account

### Step 1: Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hudsonpoirier-wq/sat-thrive.git
cd sat-thrive
```

### Step 2: Set Up Supabase (Database + Auth)

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project. Pick any name and a strong database password. Choose a region close to your users.
2. Wait for the project to finish provisioning (about 1 minute).
3. Go to **Project Settings > API** and copy these two values:
   - `Project URL` (looks like `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
   - `anon public` key (a long string starting with `eyJ...`)
4. Go to **SQL Editor** in the Supabase dashboard.
5. Open the file `supabase-schema.sql` from this repo, copy the entire contents, paste it into the SQL Editor, and click **Run**. This creates all the tables, columns, and security policies the app needs:
   - `profiles` — user accounts with name, email, role, school affiliation
   - `test_attempts` — every test taken, with answers, scores, timing, and weak topics
   - `studied_topics` — chapter completion and practice question tracking
   - `mistakes` — wrong answers with hints, notes, and spaced repetition data
   - `post_scores` — milestone score snapshots for progress tracking
   - `reviews` — mistake review scheduling
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies so each user can only see their own data
6. Go to **Authentication > Settings > Email** and set:
   - **Enable email confirmations**: ON or OFF (your choice — if OFF, users can sign in immediately after signup)
   - **Confirm email template**: leave as default

### Step 3: Create a Local Environment File

In the project root, create a file called `.env.local`:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6...your-anon-key
```

Replace the values with the ones you copied from Supabase in Step 2.

### Step 4: Install Dependencies and Run Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:5173`. Create an account and you should see the landing page, then login, then the dashboard.

### Step 5: Deploy to Vercel

1. Push this repo to your own GitHub account (fork it or create a new repo and push).
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com), click **Add New Project**, and import your GitHub repo.
3. In the Vercel project settings, go to **Settings > Environment Variables** and add:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` = your Supabase project URL
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = your Supabase anon key
4. Vercel will auto-detect Vite. The default build settings work out of the box:
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `dist`
   - **Install Command**: `npm install`
5. Click **Deploy**. It takes about 30 seconds. Your site is now live.

Every time you push to the `main` branch, Vercel automatically rebuilds and deploys.

### Step 6: (Optional) Create an Admin Account

The admin panel lets you manage students, view all test data, and extract answer keys from PDFs.

1. Sign up through the app with the email `agora@admin.org`
2. In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
```sql
UPDATE public.profiles SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'agora@admin.org';
```
3. Log out and back in. You will now see the admin panel.

### Step 7: (Optional) Custom Domain

In Vercel, go to **Settings > Domains** and add your custom domain. Follow the DNS instructions Vercel gives you.

## How Everything Works

### Landing Page (`/`)

The first thing visitors see. Public — no login required. Features:
- 3D floating educational tools (pencils, calculators, rulers, books, protractors, bar graphs) built with Three.js and React Three Fiber
- Animated logo that slides up from the bottom
- Feature overview, how-it-works timeline, animated stat counters
- SAT vs ACT comparison cards
- Interactive exam coverage toggle (click SAT or ACT to see what sections are covered)
- Mock dashboard preview in a browser frame
- About Us section
- Sign In / Get Started buttons that link to `/login`

### Onboarding Flow

1. **Sign Up** (`/login`) — create an account, pick Student or Tutor role, enter name and school
2. **Choose Exam** (`/choose-test`) — pick SAT or ACT (can switch anytime from the sidebar)
3. **Pick Test Date** (`/pick-test-date`) — select your upcoming test date from the official schedule
4. **Prior Score** (`/prior-score`, optional) — enter a previous score. This populates your score tiles but still lets you take the full diagnostic pre-test later
5. **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) — your home base

### Dashboard (`/dashboard`)

The main hub after login. Shows:
- Score overview tiles: Best Score, Highest Test, Most Recent, Improvement, Percentile, Superscore
- Pre-test CTA (if you haven't taken the diagnostic yet — even if you entered a prior score)
- Resource cards linking to every feature (Study Guide, Practice, Mistakes, Strategies, Extra Tests, Calendar, College Recruiting, Compare Tests, Formula Sheet, Journey, Tasks)
- Score trend chart (appears after first completed test)
- Recent test attempts with scores and dates
- Study progress by chapter with completion percentages

---

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Where to Set | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | `.env.local` + Vercel | Your Supabase project URL |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | `.env.local` + Vercel | Your Supabase anonymous/public API key |

These are the only two environment variables needed. Never commit `.env.local` to git.

---

## Common Tasks

### Add a new practice test

1. Add the test PDF to `public/`
2. Add the answer key to `src/data/extraAnswerKeys.js`
3. Add the test entry to `src/data/tests.js`
4. Add page mappings to `src/data/extraPdfPageMaps.js`

### Change the landing page

Edit `src/pages/Landing.jsx`. The 3D objects are defined as React Three Fiber components in the same file. The data (features, steps, stats) is at the top of the file.

### Modify the study guide content

Edit `src/data/guideContent.js` (SAT) or `src/data/actGuideContent.js` (ACT).

### Update college data

Edit `src/data/collegeData.js`. Each college has: name, rank, location, size, cost, test policy, SAT/ACT score ranges, majors, and domain for logo fetching.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Blank screen after deploy | Check that `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set in Vercel environment variables |
| "Missing Supabase environment variables" | Create `.env.local` with both variables, then restart `npm run dev` |
| Login works but dashboard is empty | Run `supabase-schema.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor — the tables haven't been created yet |
| College logos not showing | Check that `vercel.json` CSP `img-src` includes `https://*.edu https://*.google.com https://icon.horse https://icons.duckduckgo.com` |
| Build fails on Vercel | Make sure you're using Node 18+. In Vercel settings, set Node.js version to 18.x or higher |
| "ERESOLVE" dependency error | Run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` |
| PDF not rendering | `pdfjs-dist` is excluded from Vite optimization — this is intentional in `vite.config.js` |
