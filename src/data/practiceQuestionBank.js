    stem: 'A 45-45-90 triangle has a hypotenuse of length 8√2. What is the length of each leg?',
    answer: '8',
    explanation: 'In a 45-45-90 triangle, the relationship between the legs and hypotenuse is: leg × √2 = hypotenuse. So each leg = hypotenuse / √2 = 8√2 / √2 = 8.'

    explanation: 'The angle of depression from the top equals the angle of elevation from the car. Using tan(30°) = opposite/adjacent = 120/d, we get d = 120/tan(30°) = 120/0.577 ≈ 207.8 feet. Alternatively, since tan(30°) = 1/√3, d = 120√3 ≈ 120(1.732) = 207.8 feet.'

    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'If sin(A) = opposite/hypotenuse = 7/25, then the opposite side is 7 and the hypotenuse is 25. Find the adjacent side using the Pythagorean theorem: adjacent = √(25² - 7²) = √(625 - 49) = √576 = 24. Therefore cos(A) = adjacent/hypotenuse = 24/25.'

    explanation: 'Complete the square for both variables. Group: (x² - 6x) + (y² + 4y) = 12. Complete: (x² - 6x + 9) + (y² + 4y + 4) = 12 + 9 + 4. Result: (x - 3)² + (y + 2)² = 25. So the radius is √25 = 5, and the center is (3, -2).'
